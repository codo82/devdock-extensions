## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-24

### Changed
- Moved out of DevDock, where it was a built-in extension up to 1.23: same features (PM2 process list, start/stop/restart/delete, streaming logs, npm scripts started under PM2 from the NPM section, MCP tools `pm2_list` and `pm2_logs`).
- Requires DevDock 2.0 or later (`"devdock": "^2.0"`); install it from the DevDock Extensions panel (🧩) or with `npm run ext -- install pm2`.
