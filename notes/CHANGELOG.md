# Changelog

All notable changes to the `notes` extension. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/); releases are tagged `notes@<version>`.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.2.0] - 2026-10-27

### Changed
- **Free board**: lists and notes are no longer in two separate grids: they stay together on one board where each one is placed freely, dragged from its top bar (⠿ on lists, the band on notes) to any position, on a 10 px step. The board grows as cards are moved further right or down; cards can overlap, the last one moved stays on top.
- Lists can be made wider or narrower from their bottom-right corner (their height follows the items); notes are resized freely in width and height. A double click on the corner gives back the initial size.
- Position, size and stacking order are saved with the card, encrypted like the rest. Boards saved by 1.0 and 1.1 get an initial layout (rows of four, lists first), and notes made wider in columns keep their width in pixels.
- New lists and notes appear at the top left of the visible part of the board. *Move before* / *Move after* in the list menu are gone (lists are dragged).

## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-27

### Added
- **Resizable notes**: drag the bottom-right corner of a note to make it wider (1 to 3 columns of the grid, never more than the panel has) and taller or shorter; the size is saved with the note (encrypted like the rest) and a double click on the corner brings it back to the normal size.

### Fixed
- The summary next to the board name no longer says "0 to do of 0" when the board has only notes.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-10-27

### Added
- **Boards**: one per project of Kelbo plus *General*, in the sidebar with the projects' folders and the number of open items; boards of projects removed from Kelbo are kept under *Removed projects*. The tab badge counts the open items of every board.
- **To-do lists**: several per board, each with a name (edited in place) and items to check; add with Enter, edit in place (Enter saves, Esc cancels), check/uncheck, delete, reorder by dragging (⋮⋮); done items go under the open ones, struck through with when they were done, and *Clear done* removes them; lists are moved before/after or deleted from their ⋯ menu.
- **Notes**: sticky notes in a grid, free text saved automatically a moment after the last keystroke, six colours, delete; a note changed elsewhere in the meantime is not overwritten.
- **Encrypted with the master password**: the content of each board (list names, items, notes) is one box encrypted by Kelbo's vault in `notesBoards`; with the vault locked the section shows only *Unlock* and every route answers `423`. Changing the master password re-encrypts it; resetting it deletes it. Export/Import checkbox *Note e to-do*, with the content still encrypted.
